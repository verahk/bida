# bida
This repository contains code implementing the Bayesian IDA (BIDA) to categorical variables.
The BIDA method estimates intervention distributions and causal effects from observational data, under the assumption that the causal model is an unknown causal Bayesian network. 
More specifically, for each cause-effect pair in the considered system, a posterior distribution over the associated intervention distributions are computed by combining Bayesian estimation of intervention distributions through the so-called backdoor formula with Bayesian model averaging.
